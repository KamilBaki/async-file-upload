# async-file-upload
This is my inital attempt to create asynchronous file upload using Java 8 leveraging Spring. This is also my first project in GitHub.

This project is developed using Cloud IDE Codenvy with gradle. This is the first time I am using this technologies and tools.

Kudos goes to Spring because I am developing this project using their technologies, docs and guides, especially https://spring.io/guides/gs/uploading-files/

# Requirements, Building, and Running

Requires Java 8 and Gradle.

From inside the project directory (asyn-file-upload), execute the following command:

gradle build && java -jar build/libs/async-file-upload-0.1.0.jar

Open your browser at http://hostname:8080 (usually localhost)

# Todos
Make the file upload asynchronous :D
